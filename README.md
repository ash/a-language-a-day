This book provides a concise overview of 21 different programming languages. Each language is introduced using the same approach: solving several programming problems to showcase its features and capabilities. Languages covered in the book: C++, Clojure, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Factor, Go, Hack, Hy, Io, Julia, Kotlin, Lua, Mercury, Nim, OCaml, Raku, Rust, Scala, and TypeScript.

Each chapter covers the essentials of a different programming language. To make the content more consistent and comparable, I use the same structure for each language, focusing on the following mini projects:

- Creating a ‘Hello, World!’ program.
- Implementing a Factorial function using recursion or a functional-style approach.
- Creating a polymorphic array of objects (a ‘zoo’ of cats and dogs) and calling methods on them.
- Implementing the Sleep Sort algorithm—while impractical for real-word use, it’s a playful demonstration of language’s concurrency capabilities.

Each language description follows—where applicable—this pattern:

- Installing a command-line compiler and running a program.
- Creating and using variables.
- Defining and using functions.
- Exploring object-oriented features.
- Handling exception.
- Introducing basic concurrency and parallelism.

You can buy it on Amazon or LeanPub as an electronic or Kindle edition, or as a paper hardcover or paperback version. More information with the links to the shops: https://andrewshitov.com/a-language-a-day/
